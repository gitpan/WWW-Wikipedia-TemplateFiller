WWW::Wikipedia::TemplateFiller installation
===========================================

The easiest way to install WWW::Wikipedia::TemplateFiller is via the
CPAN, which automatically checks for and installs dependencies as
needed.

If you wish to test the ISBNdb functionality, you will need to provide
your ISBNdb developer's access key before 'make test' is invoked by the CPAN.
This can be done in the shell with something like

  $ export ISBNDB_ACCESS_KEY=your_key_here

And then enter CPAN and install the module:

  $ cpan WWW::Wikipedia::TemplateFiller

Warnings during installation
============================

You may receive warnings during installation. The following are safe
to ignore:

  t/01-fill.........ok 7/16Parsing of undecoded UTF-8 will give garbage when decoding entities at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.6/WWW/Mechanize.pm line 449, <DATA> line 484.
  t/01-fill.........ok 8/16Parsing of undecoded UTF-8 will give garbage when decoding entities at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.6/WWW/Mechanize.pm line 449, <DATA> line 484.
  t/01-fill.........ok 11/16Use of uninitialized value in length at /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.6/Text/ParseWords.pm line 29.
  t/01-fill.........ok 12/16Use of uninitialized value in length at /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.6/Text/ParseWords.pm line 29.

If anyone has a way to resolve these warnings, feel free to drop me an
email.

Web access
==========

W::W::TF comes with a built-in web application for deploying the
template filler via the web. The application is coded in
W::W::TF::WebApp and uses the CGI::Application framework. An instance
script that uses W::W::TF::WebApp is available as well; it is called
cgi/index.cgi. Templates used by W::W::TF::WebApp are stored in
cgi/templates.

To install these files, copy the cgi directory to your cgi-bin
directory and provide proper file permissions to files contained
therein. For example:

  % cp -r cgi /var/www/cgi-bin/wtf

For permissions, something like this ought to work:

  % chmod 655 /var/www/cgi-bin/wtf/index.cgi
  % chmod a+r /var/www/cgi-bin/wtf/templates/*

Update the %config hash in /var/www/cgi-bin/wtf/index.cgi to point to
the templates directory and assign an ISBNdb access key:

  # Inside /var/www/cgi-bin/wtf/index.cgi:
  my %config = (
    template_path => '/var/www/cgi-bin/wtf/templates',
    isbndb_access_key => 'your_access_key',
  );

The template filler should then be available via a standard URL:

  http://www.yourhost.com/cgi-bin/wtf/index.cgi
