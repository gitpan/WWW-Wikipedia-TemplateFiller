version: 0.10
date:    2009-01-29
changes:
  - (bug #42908) rename "chembox new" to "chembox"
  - Ugly hack for Mac OS X's case-insensitive but case-preserving
    filesystem

version: 0.09
date:    2008-11-25
changes:
  - (bug #41162) another attempt to fix 'make test' in perl 5.10.x
  - this entailed removing references to sprintf() in the code, as
    sprintf() is currently complaining about the use of tainted
    values.
    (cf. http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41162#txn-537097)

version: 0.08
date:    2008-11-23
changes:
  - (bug #41162) fix 'make test' in perl 5.10.x
  - in fixing above, switched template parameter descriptions from
    older 'field', '-field', and '+field' notation to using more
    descriptive names in a hash (eg, "field => { value => 'foo', show
    => 'if-extended' }", etc.)

version: 0.07
date:    2008-11-18
changes:
  - (bug #41053) get() now dies if $id is undefined
  - in fixing this bug, change W::W::TF::S::PubmedcentralId.pm to no
    longer inherit from PubmedId; now calls to get() are routed
    through $self->filler->get() to ensure that W::W::TF's get()
    (which appropriately handles empty IDs) is called
  - WebApp.pm now traps errors thrown during template filling and
    issues error message appropriately, preventing the die() from
    being propagated to Apache
