WWW::Wikipedia::TemplateFiller
==============================

This module generates Wikipedia template markup for various sources of
information such as PubMed IDs, ISBNs, URLs, etc. While it works with
multiple templates, it was predominantly created to lower the
activation energy associated with filling out citation templates.

In writing a Wikipedia article, one aims to cite sufficient
references. The trouble is that there are many different ways of
citing different sources, all with different Wikipedia citation
templates, and many requiring information that may be difficult to
obtain. The initial goal of this module was to streamline the process
of generating citation templates. Sure, the module's grown and it's
been generalized to other templates (Drugbox, etc.), but the
principles persist.

SYNOPSIS

  use WWW::Wikipedia::TemplateFiller;

  my $filler = new WWW::Wikipedia::TemplateFiller();

  my $source = $filler->get( pubmed_id => '2309482' )->fill;
  print $source->output;
  
  # Roughly gives:
  #   {{cite journal |author=Garty BZ, Kauli R |title=Alopecia
  #   universalis in autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type I
  #   |journal=The Western journal of medicine |volume=152 |issue=1
  #   |pages=76â€“7 |year=1990 |month=January |pmid=2309482 |pmc=1002273
  #   |doi= |url=}}

  # Same thing, in one line
  print $filler->get( pubmed_id => '2309482' )->fill->output;

  # With fill-time options
  $source = $filler->get( pubmed_id => '123456' )->fill( add_url => 1 );
  print $source->output;

  # With output-time (mostly for formatting) options
  print $source->output( vertical => 1, add_accessdate => 1 );
